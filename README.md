<b>WEB CRAWLER BUILT IN PYTHON</b>

<p>This is a web crawler built using python. As it is expected that this will run on a single system, it is expected that users provide a depth upto which crawling should happen. This is done by setting the second argument in crawl to True (True by default) and the third argument is the depth. It returns a list of all the links.</p>
<p>However if you are feeling more adventurous there is another way of calling the crawl function so as to crawl the entire web. For this supply the second argument as False instead of true. In this case instead of returning all the links it prints out individual links as and when they are found</p>
